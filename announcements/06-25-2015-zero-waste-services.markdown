---

**Oakland, CA** – Oakland Recycles will launch important new trash, compost and recycling services on July 1 as Oakland takes a huge step toward its Zero Waste goal to keep all recyclable and compostable material out of landfills.
The new services and features include new natural gas-powered service trucks that run cleaner and quieter; new ways for all residents to easily dispose of mattresses, furniture and other bulky items; and for the first time ever, guaranteed compost service for condo and apartment residents.

“I’m proud of Oakland for once more demonstrating world-class leadership to protect our environment,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said. “What is most important about this next step is that we’re taking it together: these efforts to protect our environment can only be successful with the remarkable commitment and participation of Oakland’s residents and businesses.”

Effective July 1, Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. (WMAC) will be the exclusive provider of trash and compost service for Oakland residents and businesses. California Waste Solutions (CWS) will be the exclusive provider of recycling service for residents. Recycling for businesses remains an open market in which Oakland business owners can shop for the recycling service provider they prefer
