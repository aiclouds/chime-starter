# Chime Starter

This repo contains a starter site for city governments. Its main purpose is for use with Chime CMS but does not require it. This starter site currently contains:

- A Jekyll site
- A foundational CSS structure built with Sass
- A grid-based layout system using Bourbon and Neat
- Basic web typography
- City-government specific page templates
- A Jekyll Plugin that generates the article index pages based off of the folder hierarchy.
- A living style guide and pattern library
- Polyfills that help older versions of IE support HTML5 elements, pseudoclasses, media queries, and rem units.


## Prerequisites

This starter requires Jekyll to be installed in order to build and preview. To install Jekyll, run:

> `gem install jekyll`


## Running Locally

To preview the site locally, use the Jekyll command:

> `jekyll serve`

The site should be viewable at localhost:4000. The styleguide is located at 'localhost:4000/styleguide'.
